Building LSL Apps
=================

Advanced developers may wish to use :doc:`build_full_tree`.

The instructions below are recommended for most users.
Most LabStreamingLayer applications have a similar structure
and use similar build tools. These instructions are general
and should work for most applications. Always be sure to read
the specific application build instructions first.

#. Make sure you have a working :doc:`build_env`.

#. Get the source code for your application.

   * If you are creating a new C++ application to add support for a device then
     generate a project from the
     `AppTemplate_cpp_qt <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/AppTemplate_cpp_qt/generate>`__

   * git clone the application

#. Create the build directory

   * You can use a GUI file manager to do this part or you can do it by command
     line as below.
   * Open a terminal/shell/command prompt and change to the repository
     directory.
   * If the build directory is already there then delete it

       * Windows: :cmd:`rmdir /S build`; Others: :cmd:`rm -Rf build`

#. Configure the project using :ref:`lslbuildenv` cmake.

   * Option 1 - Visual Studio 2017 or later (**recommended**)

      * Open the :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file in Visual Studio
        (:guilabel:`File->Open->CMake`)
      * Change CMake settings via :guilabel:`CMake->Change CMake Settings`

         * See `Common CMake Settings <#common-cmake-options>`__ below

      * Change the selected project from the drop-down menu (:guilabel:`x64-Debug`,
        :guilabel:`x64-Release`). This will trigger a CMake re-configure with the new variables.

   * Option 2 - Using commandline.

      *  Open a Terminal window or, on Windows, a ``x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017`` (or VS2019, as needed).
      *  Run cmake with appropriate `commandline options <#common-cmake-options>`__.

   * Option 3 - Using the GUI

      * Open a terminal/shell/command prompt and change to the repository directory.
      * Run :cmd:`cmake-gui -S . -B build`
      * Do an initial :guilabel:`Configure`. Agree to create the directory if asked.
      * Select your compiler and click Finish.
      * Use the interface to set or add options/paths (:guilabel:`Add Entry`).

          * :ref:`Qt5` if the guessed path is not right
          * :ref:`Boost` if the default was not correct
          * A path where redistributable binaries get copied (``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``)
          * Build type (``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``, either ``Release`` or ``Debug``). You can change this in Visual Studio later.

      * Click on :guilabel:`Configure` again to confirm changes.
      * Click on :guilabel:`Generate` to create the build files / Visual Studio Solution file

#. Build the project

   * If using command line

      * Start the build process (:cmd:`cmake --build . --config Release --target install`)
      * (see also :ref:`cmakeinstalltarget`)

   * If using Visual Studio >=2017 built-in CMake utilities
      * Use the menu :guilabel:`CMake > Install > ApplicationName`

This will create a distribution tree in the folder specified by
:ref:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX <cmakeinstalltarget>` similar to this:

‘installed’ directory tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

     ├── AppX
     │   ├── AppX.exe
     │   ├── liblsl64.dll
     │   ├── Qt5Xml.dll
     │   ├── Qt5Gui.dll
     │   ├── VendorDevice.dll
     │   └── AppX_configuration.ini
     └── LSL
       ├── share
       │   ├── LSL
       │   │   ├── LSLCMake.cmake
       │   │   ├── LSLConfig.cmake
       │   │   └── LSLCMake.cmake
       ├── include
       │   ├── lsl_c.h
       │   └── lsl_cpp.h
       └── lib
         ├── liblsl64.dll
         ├── liblsl64.lib
         └── lslboost.lib

On Unix systems (Linux+OS X) the executable’s library path is changed to
include :file:`../LSL/lib/` and the executable folder (:file:`./`) so common
libraries (Qt, Boost) can be distributed in a single library directory
or put in the same folder.
On Windows, the library is copied to (and searched in) the executable folder.

Common CMake Options
--------------------

The cmake build system has many options. If you are using the CMake GUI
then these options will be presented to you before you generate the
project/makefiles.

If you are using the commandline then default options will generate
makefiles for liblsl only. If you want to use the commandline to
generate a project for an IDE, or to generate a project that builds LSL
Apps, then you will have to provide some optional arguments to the cmake
command.

-  `Generator <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#cmake-generators>`__:
    ``-G <generator name>``.

-  App dependencies (required by some apps). See :ref:`lslbuildenv` for more info.
   - :samp:`-DVendor_ROOT={<path/to/vendor/sdk>}`
   - :samp:`-DQt5_DIR={<path/to/qt/binaries>}/lib/cmake/Qt5`

      - On MacOS the path can be learned from homebrew:
        :samp:`-DQt5_DIR=$(brew --prefix qt5)/lib/cmake/Qt5`

   - ``-DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost>``

- Location of liblsl (see :doc:`LSL_INSTALL_ROOT`)

- Use ``-DLSL_UNIXFOLDERS=0`` on MacOS if your application is not bundled with its dylib.

- Please check the application's README and/or BUILD document for more options.


Configure CMake options in VS 2017 / VS 2019
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Visual Studio 2017’s built-in CMake Tools then the
default options would have been used to configure the project. To set
any variables you have to edit a file. Use the CMake menu > Change CMake
Settings > ApplicationName. This will open a json file. For each
configuration, add a ‘variables’ entry with a list of
key/value pairs. For example, under ``"name": "x64-Release",`` and
immediately after ``"ctestCommandArgs": ""`` add the following:

::

   ,
         "variables": [
           {
             "name": "Qt5_DIR",
             "value": "C:\\Qt\\5.11.1\\msvc2015_64\\lib\\cmake\\Qt5 "
           },
           {
             "name": "BOOST_ROOT",
             "value": "C:\\local\\boost_1_67_0"
           },
           {
             "name": "Vendor_ROOT",
             "value": "C:\\path\\to\\vendor\\sdk"
           },
           {
             "name": "LSL_INSTALL_ROOT",
             "value": "C:\\path\\to\\liblsl\\install"
           }
         ]
