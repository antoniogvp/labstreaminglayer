Building LSL
============

This manual describes the process of building liblsl 
from source for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Since liblsl is
cross-platform (it is written in standard C++ and uses some boost
libraries), this process should be pretty straightforward. The following
paragraphs provide a step-by-step instruction of the build process on
all three platforms.

Project Structure
-----------------

This repository contains only the general project structure and
references (“`git
submodules <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`__”) to
the liblsl C/C++ library
(`LSL/liblsl <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl/>`__),
various language bindings (e.g.
`LSL/liblsl-Python <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Python>`__),
the Apps to stream data from several types of devices including template
Examples,
and the
`LabRecorder <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder>`__.:

To get the project with Git, see :doc:`full_tree`.


Dependencies (optional)
-----------------------

The core ``liblsl`` does not have any external dependencies.

Different language bindings or apps have their own dependencies so
please consult those projects’ build instructions.

Many apps depend on :ref:`Qt5` so we provide some quick instructions
here, but this may not be necessary for you depending on what you are
building.

-  Windows:

   -  `CMake <https://cmake.org/download/>`__
   -  `Qt5 <https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/>`__

-  Mac - Use `homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__ (``brew install cmake qt``)

-  Ubuntu (/Debian):
     :cmd:`sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake qt5-default`

A few apps also depend on :ref:`Boost`.

Build instructions
------------------

First, set up your :doc:`build_env`.

There are three build types:

1. `in tree builds <#in-tree-builds-recommended>`__ build the LSL
   library and all apps you explicitly enable. This is probably what you
   want.
2. `out of tree builds <#out-of-tree-builds>`__ build only a single app
   and require you to have a prebuilt LSL library and the exported build
   configuration (``LSLConfig.cmake``).
3. `semi out of tree builds <#semi-out-of-tree-builds>`__ build only a
   single app and liblsl alongside it.

In tree builds (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. clone the repository
   (``git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/labstreaminglayer.git``)
2. Create the build directory

-  You can use a GUI file manager to do this part or you can do it by
   command line as below.
-  Open a terminal/shell/command prompt and change to the
   labstreaminglayer directory.

   -  If the build directory is already there then delete it

      -  Windows: :cmd:`rmdir /S build`; Others: :cmd:`rm -Rf build`

1. Configure the project using :ref:`buildenvcmake`

- Option 1 - Visual Studio 2017 or later

   -  Open the :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file in Visual Studio
      (:guilabel:`File->Open->CMake`)
   -  Change CMake settings via :guilabel:`CMake->Change CMake Settings`

      -  See `Common Cmake Settings <#common-cmake-options>`__ below

   -  Change the selected project from the drop-down menu (:guilabel:`x64-Debug`,
      :guilabel:`x64-Release`).
      This will trigger a CMake re-configure with the new variables.

-  Option 2 - Using commandline.

   -  Open a Terminal window or, on Windows, a ‘Developer Command Prompt
      for VS2017’ (or 2019, as needed)
   -  Run cmake with appropriate `commandline options <#common-cmake-options>`__.

-  Option 3 - Using the GUI

   -  Open a terminal/shell/command prompt and change to the
      labstreaminglayer directory (:cmd:`cmake-gui -S . -B build`)
   -  Do an initial :guilabel:`Configure`.
      Agree to create the directory if asked.
   -  Select your compiler and click Finish.
   -  Use the interface to set or add options/paths (:guilabel:`Add Entry`).

      -  :ref:`Qt5` if the guessed path is not right
      -  :ref:`Boost` if the default was not correct
      -  A path where redistributable binaries get copied
         (``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``)
      -  Build type (``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``, either ``Release`` or
         ``Debug``). You can change this in Visual Studio later.
      -  Click on :guilabel:`Configure` again to confirm changes.

   -  Click on :guilabel:`Generate` to create the build files / Visual Studio
      Solution file

2. Build the project
-  If using command line

   -  Start the build process
      (:cmd:`cmake --build . --config Release --target install`
      (see also :ref:`cmakeinstalltarget`)

-  If using Visual Studio 2017 built-in CMake utilities

   -  Use the CMake menu > Install > LabStreamingLayer

This will create a distribution tree in the folder specified by
:ref:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX <cmakeinstalltarget>` similar to this:

‘installed’ directory tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

     ├── AppX
     │   ├── AppX.exe
     │   ├── lsl.dll
     │   ├── Qt5Xml.dll
     │   ├── Qt5Gui.dll
     │   └── AppX_configuration.ini
     ├── AppY
     │   ├── AppY.exe
     │   ├── AppY_conf.exe
     │   ├── lsl.dll
     │   └── example.png
     ├── examples
     │   ├── CppReceive.exe
     │   ├── CppSendRand.exe
     │   ├── SendDataC.exe
     │   ├── lsl.dll
     └── LSL
       ├── share
       │   ├── LSL
       │   │   ├── LSLCMake.cmake
       │   │   ├── LSLConfig.cmake
       │   │   └── LSLCMake.cmake
       ├── include
       │   ├── lsl_c.h
       │   └── lsl_cpp.h
       └── lib
         ├── lsl.dll
         ├── liblsl.lib
         └── lslboost.lib

On Unix systems (Linux+OS X) the executable’s library path is changed to
include :file:`../LSL/lib/` and the executable folder (:file:`./`) so common
libraries (Qt, Boost) can be distributed in a single library directory
or put in the same folder.
On Windows, the library is copied to (and searched in) the executable folder.

The resulting folder :file:`LSL` contains three subfolders:

-  :file:`cmake` contains the exported build configuration
   (:file:`LSLConfig.cmake`) that can be used to import the library in `out
   of tree builds <#out-of-tree-builds>`__.
-  :file:`include` contains the include headers for C (:file:`lsl_c.h`) and C++
   (:file:`lsl_cpp.h`) programs.
-  :file:`lib` contains the library files. To run a program, you need the
   :file:`lsl.dll` (Windows) or :file:`liblsl.so` (Linux) or
   :file:`liblsl.dylib` (MacOS).

Out of tree builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An out of tree build doesn’t include the whole ``labstreaminglayer``
directory but only a single application (a minimal example is contained
in the
```OutOfTreeTest`` <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-OutOfTreeTest>`__
folder).

Building the LSL library should take only 1-2 minutes, so you should
prefer `in tree builds <#in-tree-builds-recommended>`__ unless you know
what you’re doing.

The process for building liblsl and each app separately is almost
exactly as for `in tree builds <#in-tree-builds-recommended>`__. The
only difference is that you need to ``cd`` to each submodule separately,
create a build directory (``mkdir build``) and build liblsl / the app as
described above.

Semi out of tree builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Semi out of tree builds build only a single app, but liblsl doesn’t have
to be precompiled because the liblsl source directory is included as a
build target. These builds are preferable if you need to change / debug
both the app and liblsl, but because compiling liblsl takes considerably
longer than most apps you shouldn’t do it for more than one app (see `in
tree builds <#in-tree-builds-recommended>`__ for that).

Common CMake Options
--------------------

The cmake build system has many options. If you are using the CMake GUI
then these options will be presented to you before you generate the
project/makefiles.

If you are using the commandline then default options will generate
makefiles for liblsl only. If you want to use the commandline to
generate a project for an IDE, or to generate a project that builds LSL
Apps, then you will have to provide some optional arguments to the cmake
command.

-  `Generator <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#cmake-generators>`__:
   ``-G <generator name>``.
-  Apps: ``-DLSLAPPS_<AppName>=ON``.

   -  ``-DLSLAPPS_LabRecorder=ON``
   -  ``-DLSLAPPS_XDFBrowser=ON``
   -  ``-DLSLAPPS_OpenVR=ON``
   -  TODO: Each app should have its cmake option easily accessible in
      its readme.
   -  TODO: Each app should have its own additional options specified in
      its readme.

-  App dependencies (required by some apps). See :ref:`lslbuildenv` for more info.

   -  ``-DQt5_DIR=<path/to/qt/binaries>/lib/cmake/Qt5``
   -  ``-DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost>``

      -  liblsl comes with its own boost used by itself, but it is not
         uncommon for apps to require ‘normal’ boost.

-  Install root (`see below <#LSL_INSTALL_ROOT>`__)

   -  Not necessary for in-tree builds.

Here are some example cmake commands:

-  Chad’s Windows build:
   ``cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DLSL_LSLBOOST_PATH="lslboost" -DQt5_DIR=C:\Qt\5.11.1\msvc2015_64\lib\cmake\Qt5 -DBOOST_ROOT=C:\local\boost_1_67_0 -DLSLAPPS_LabRecorder=ON -DLSLAPPS_XDFBrowser=ON -DLSLAPPS_OpenVR=ON``
-  Chad’s Mac build:
   ``cmake .. -DLSL_LSLBOOST_PATH="lslboost" -DLSLAPPS_Examples=ON -DLSLAPPS_LabRecorder=ON -DLSLAPPS_Benchmarks=ON -DLSLAPPS_XDFBrowser=ON -DQt5_DIR=$(brew --prefix qt)/lib/cmake/Qt5/``

Configure CMake options in VS 2017 / VS 2019
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Visual Studio 2017’s built-in CMake Tools then the
default options would have been used to configure the project. To set
any variables you have to edit a file. Use the CMake menu > Change CMake
Settings > LabStreamingLayer. This will open a json file. For each
configuration of interest, add a ‘variables’ entry with a list of
key/value pairs. For example, under ``"name": "x64-Release",`` and
immediately after ``"ctestCommandArgs": ""`` add the following:

::

   ,
         "variables": [
           {
             "name": "Qt5_DIR",
             "value": "C:\\Qt\\5.11.1\\msvc2015_64\\lib\\cmake\\Qt5 "
           },
           {
             "name": "BOOST_ROOT",
             "value": "C:\\local\\boost_1_67_0"
           },
           {
             "name": "LSLAPPS_LabRecorder",
             "value": "ON"
           },
           {
             "name": "LSLAPPS_Benchmarks",
             "value": "ON"
           },
           {
             "name": "LSLAPPS_XDFBrowser",
             "value": "ON"
           }
         ]

``LSL_INSTALL_ROOT``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To import the LSL library in a separate CMake build, you need to set the
the **absolute path** to the `‘installed’ LSL
directory <#install-directory-tree>`__ in the ``LSL_INSTALL_ROOT``
variable (e.g. ``-DLSL_INSTALL_ROOT=C:/LSL/build/install/``) or add the
**absolute path** to the\ ``LSL/cmake`` subfolder of the `‘installed’
LSL directory <#install-directory-tree>`__ to your ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
(``list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "C:/path/to/LSL/build/install/cmake/")``.

CMake looks for the file
``${LSL_INSTALL_ROOT}/LSL/share/LSL/LSLConfig.cmake``, so make sure your
``LSL_INSTALL_ROOT`` has the files listed in `the previous
section <#installed-directory-tree>`__.

By default, apps should look in ``../../LSL/liblsl/build/install`` so if
you have a ``build`` folder in each submodule (``LSL/liblsl/build``,
``Apps/LabRecorder/build`` etc.) and installed ``liblsl`` first, CMake
automatically finds liblsl.

Building for multiple platforms
-------------------------------

In case you haven’t got several PCs and Macs with different build
environments to test your changes, you can use the CI to
compile the code on multiple platforms and offer binaries to willing
testers.

Raspberry Pi (cross-compilation, currently not working)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intended for Ubuntu 18.04

-  In terminal, cd to a working folder.
-  ``git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git``
-  ``export PITOOLS=/path/to/raspberrypi/tools``
-  Change to labstreaminglayer directory
-  ``mkdir build_pi && cd build_pi``
-  ``cmake .. -DLSL_LSLBOOST_PATH="lslboost" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../LSL/liblsl/pi.cmake``
-  ``make``

Raspberry Pi (native Raspbian)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just follow the usual `build instructions <#build-instructions>`__.

Some caveats:

-  Make sure your charger is appropriate (>2.5A@5V for the 3B+),
   otherwise the build will hang or your Pi will reset.
-  Avoid building with a running GUI, minimize the GPU memory (option
   ``gpu_mem`` in ``/boot/config.txt``) and have at most 2 build
   processes running at once (``-j`` option to make / ninja).
